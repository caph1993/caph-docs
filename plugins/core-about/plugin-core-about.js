          <p>A library for writing HTML documents and slides that look nice, are editable in plain-text and can be exported to standalone HTML files, so that they can be opened in a browser by anyone, anywhere, except IE broswer (LoL).</p>
          <p>It supports several plugins, including math, diagrams, charts, images, code snippets and a whiteboard. We encourage HTML+css over markdown and other document languages because HTML+css is universal and flexible. You will never regret about learning HTML+css.</p>
